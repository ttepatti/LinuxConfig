#	LinuxConfig

This is my new and fancy Linux Config. I did away with my old config and decided to start fresh.

I'm currently running this on Debian Stretch 9.7.0.

Rather than being a complete clone of my dotfiles like the last repo was, this repo is more focused on how to set up a fresh system in a way that's useful to me and contains lots of tweaks and hacks to make my life easier.

## Prerequisites

All of this was tested on Debian Stretch 9.7.0

Version 2 is aiming to be more modular than Version 1 - This repo will be similar to a collection of tutorials, each one dependent from the rest. Each tutorial will provide its own README along with a list of prerequisites.
